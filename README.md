# Azure App Insights SAP-Fiori plugin Quickstart (PREVIEW)

This repos describes how to utilize a [SAP Fiori Launchpad Plugin](https://assets.cdn.sap.com/sapcom/docs/2019/03/b2dff710-427d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.pdf) to gain **client-side insights** into Fiori metrics with [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview?tabs=net). It leverages the standard views for Azure Application Insights and a dedicated Azure Monitor Workbook for SAP.

> **Note**
> Find official API documentation for the Azure Application Insights JS snippet [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS#snippet-setup-ignore-if-using-npm-setup).

A typical single instance setup would look like below. The plugin concept applies to native SAP on Azure deployments, SAP RISE, on-premises and [SAP BTP Build WorkZone, Standard edition](https://help.sap.com/docs/Launchpad_Service/8c8e1958338140699bd4811b37b82ece/9db48fa44f7e4c62a01bc74c82e74e07.html).

> **Note**
> Connection from BTP to the SAP workload on Azure can be done with the cloud-native [SAP Private Link Service for Azure](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/29/getting-started-with-btp-private-link-service-for-azure/) or the [SAP Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html) (SCC). For any-premises choose Azure VNet integration via [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)/VPN or the SCC.

> **Note** - The reverse proxy is required in case of strict [CORS policies](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-SAP-Fiori-Plugin#how-to-deal-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-errors). Proxy choices range from managed services like [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) or [Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview) to self-hosted solutions like Apache.

ðŸ§ªTested with Business Suite NW 7.51 and S/4HANA 2022 using Edge Browser.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Application Insights instance (access to [connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net#find-your-connection-string))
2. Imported [Azure Monitor Workbook](Fiori-Performance-Analysis.workbook) (Create new, open code view <kbd></></kbd>, select Gallery template, copy & paste the json into it and save)
3. Fiori Launchpad with SAPUI5 1.86+ (older Fiori stacks need to consider [alternatives](#sapui5-feature-dependencies)).

> **Note** - you may upgrade your UI5 stack independently from the NetWeaver release

4. Fiori Launchpad configured to use custom Plug-Ins. See [SAP's Fiori docs](https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/03/b2dff710-427d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html) (especially steps 76 onwards) to get started.

| Parameter   | Value       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Launchpad Plugin ID      | `ZAZUREFLPPLUGIN`       | Retrieve from builder.customTasks.configuration.app.name in [ui5-deploy.yaml](ui5-deploy.yaml)       |
| Launchpad Plugin URL   | `/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/`        | Re-use from here or collect from `npm run deploy` output        |
| UI5 Component ID   | `microsoft.com.flpmonitor`        | Verify from `sap.app.id` in [manifest.json](/webapp/manifest.json)        |

> **Note**
> Optionally add Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions Instance for infrastructure telemetery correlation

### SAPUI5 feature dependencies

Default settings of this repos anticipate UI5 releases 1.86+. Use below table to understand potential feature scope for older releases.

| Feature   | SAPUI5 release       | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [AppLifeCycle](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ushell.services.AppLifeCycle)  | 1.38+ | Use SAP's public API to handle app loaded events |
| [Interaction](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/module:sap/ui/performance/trace/Interaction)  | 1.76+ | Use SAP public tracing APIs for analysis, matching SAP backend trace measurments |
| [User Info](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ushell.services.UserInfo%23methods/Summary)  | 1.86+ | Use SAP's public Fiori user API to correlate user info |
| [Passport](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/468a97775123488ab3345a0c48cadd8f/a075ed88ef324261bca41813a6ac4a1c.html)  | n.a. | Use SAP's internal API to enrich requests with RootId and TransactionId for deep linking from Azure into SAP backend transactions |

If none are applicable revert to tracking Fiori hash changes only:

```javascript
//uncomment in init function
$(window).hashchange(function () {
    window.appInsights.trackPageView();
}
```

Another alternative poses the App Insights configuration `enableAutoRouteTracking`. However, launchpad navigation durations are not reflected, because it gets treated as a large single-page-application (SPA).

## Local build instructions (SAP Business Application Studio)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/MartinPankraz/az-monitor-sap-fiori-plugin.git
```

This app has been generated using the SAP Fiori tools - App Generator in [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio), as part of the SAP Fiori tools suite.  In order to launch the generated app, simply run the following commands from the generated app root folder:

```cmd
npm install
```

Maintain your [Azure Application Insights Connection String](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net#find-your-connection-string) and [AICloudRole](https://github.com/MartinPankraz/az-monitor-sap-fiori-plugin/blob/main/webapp/Component.js#L38) attributes on the [Component.js](https://github.com/MartinPankraz/az-monitor-sap-fiori-plugin/blob/main/webapp/Component.js#L36).

```cmd
npm run build
```

```cmd
npm start
```

## Deploying the plugin

There are multiple ways to deploy the plugin to AS ABAP. Learn more [here](documentation/DEPLOYMENT.md)

> **Note** - The provided guidance focuses on AS ABAP but the plugin also applies to the SAP Build Workzone, standard edition (formerly SAP Launchpad service). Learn more [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/sapui5-fiori-cf-deploy.html).

## How to deal with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors

Consider the `crossOrigin` setting of the App Insights [configuration](https://github.com/MartinPankraz/az-monitor-sap-fiori-plugin/blob/main/webapp/Component.js). Read more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript?tabs=snippet#configuration).

In case relaxation of the CORS policy is not an option, consider adding a reverse proxy. This is a standard practice with SAP Fiori integration with SAP Business Objects for instance. To do so adjust the hostname accordingly on the App Insights SDK by changing the [connection string](/webapp/Component.js#L40).

It would look something like this on the [Component.js](/webapp/Component.js#L40):

```cmd
cfg: { 
    connectionString:"InstrumentationKey=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx;IngestionEndpoint=https://<your-reverse-proxy-hostname>/v2/track"
}
```

and something like this on the reverse proxy with a **special port** to identify this special rewrite scenario (pseudo code):

```cmd
<If "%{HTTP_HOST} == '<your-reverse-proxy-hostname>' && %{SERVER_PORT} -eq 7777">
    Redirect "/" "https://<your azure app insights domain>/"
</If>
```

> **Note** - Learn more about the setup with Azure Application Gateway [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/url-route-overview) and for Azure Front Door [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-route-matching?pivots=front-door-standard-premium).

> **Note** - Learn more about overriding the SAP standard regarding CORS settings on the Fiori layer in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/02/embed-self-hosted-sap-fiori-launchpad-into-microsoft-teams/).

## Troubleshooting hints

Use the hot-key <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> provided for SAPUI5 to [enable debug mode](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/c9b0f8cca852443f9b8d3bf8ba5626ab.html#loioc9b0f8cca852443f9b8d3bf8ba5626ab) from your Fiori Launchpad instance to load the non-minified sources for this plugin and the Azure App Insights SDK.
